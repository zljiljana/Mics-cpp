## Misc C++ codes

This is a collection of small C++ programs I wrote to brush up on my basic coding skills. Most of them are common interview questions I found on various internet/book sources.

### Strings and Arrays

* Reverse the string and words
* Rotating strings - check if a string is a rotation of another string
* Replace spaces in a string with special characters
* Sum up integers from a text file, one int per line
* Remove duplicate characters from a string
* Remove specified list of characters from a string
* Rotate a N by N matrix in place
* Reverse a string
* Find the intersection of two strings
* Check if a string has all unique chars
* Base conversion - given A, B, ..., Z, AA, AB, ..., AZ, BA, ... and a number n return the n_th string and vice versa
* Determine if two strings are anagrams (listen - silent are anagrams)
* Print all string permutations
* Print all string combinations


### Sorting Algorithms

* Insertion sort on arrays
* Insertion sort on a linked list
* Merge sort on arrays
* Merge sort on vectors
* Merge sort on linked lists
* Bubble sort
* Quicksort on arrays


### Linked Lists

* Linked list basics
* Merge sort on a linked list
* Intersection and union of two unsorted lists
* Find the beginning of a circular list
* Find Mth to last element of a list
* Create a list that represents a sum of two lists

### Binary Search Trees

* Binary Search Tree with following functions:
** In-order print
** Pre-order print
** Post-order print
** Find min value of a tree
** Find max value of a tree
** Look up (search) for a given key
** Get the max depth of a tree
** Get the min depth of a tree
** Is a tree balanced?
** Number of nodes in a tree
** Is a tree a binary search tree
** Convert tree to an array
** Is a given tree a subtree of a big tree
** Mirror a tree (swap pointer to left and right child)
** Find a in-order succesor (node which has the next higher value)
** Find a in-order predecessor (node which has the next lower value)
** Find a lowest common ancestor
** Delete a tree
** Create a new treeo from a sorted array
** Breadth First Traversal of a tree
** Find Nth max value in a tree
