Merge sort

time: O(nlogn) â€“ worst/best/average
memory: worst case O(n) auxiliary (when working on arrays); O(1) when working on linked lists.

Merge sort is divide and conquer algorithm, it is stable (two same elements will not be swapped) and parallelizable.
Merge sort can be easily adapted to operate on linked lists and very large lists that reside in slow-to-access media.

Basic idea:
1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element
2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining.
So, merge sequence to be sorted: s_i, ..., s_j 
will be divided into two nearly equal sequences: s_i, ..., s_m        s_m+1, ..., s_j  
where m = floor((i+j)/2). Each of these two sequences are recursively sorted after which they are combined to produce the sorted arrangement of the original sequence
